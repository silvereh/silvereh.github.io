# About me

Hello, I'm {{ site.name }}!

I currently live in Rexburg, Idaho, where I just graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering.

Along my studies, I have been working as a Web Engineer for the university, accruing a total equivalent of four years of full-time employment within this role.

I started as a Front-end developer for the University Relations department. It allowed me to familiarize myself with the technology stack used by the University and to learn Bootstrap and jQuery.

After about a year and a half, I was able to move to a Back-end position, which was my goal in the first place. Then, I was able to further my understanding of the back-end technology we use: Ingeniux CMS, C#, and Razor.

I also did an internship during which I learned more about Angular, Java (Spring framework), and Oracle databases.

With that technological baggage in my hand, I am now ready to tackle the job market and am eager to learn new technologies and bring my skills and motivation to your projects.
