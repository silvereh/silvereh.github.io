Today, I decided to start the [#100DaysOfCode challenge][1]. For those of you who don't know what it is, the concept is simple. The goal is to develop good habits. For this challenge, you must spend at least 1 hour of coding everyday, for 100 days in a row, and post about it on [Twitter][2] to hold yourself accountable.

As for what I did today, I researched a better way to develop this website. So far, I have been doing it with Jekyll and Gulp to get a streamlined process. But there is one bug in my process, the live reload feature can only work once, and then I need to kill my development server and restart it. This bug really counteract the whole goal of using Jekyll and Gulp in the first place and is therefore not a very good option.

My friend Matthew told me a few weeks ago that I should try tu use [Webpack][3] for this purpose so I decided to give it a try.

From the few tries that I've given it so far, it seems that the live reload feature of Webpack is much more robust than the one in Gulp, but I haven't tried it on a higher scale project yet, only on [the tutorial example][4] on the website. I will keep digging into it and I will see where it takes me as I progress in my exploration of Webpack.
