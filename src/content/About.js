				<h2>Who am I?</h2>
				<p>I currently live in Rexburg, Idaho, where I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering.</p>
				<p>Along my studies, I have been working as a Web Engineer for the university, accruing a total equivalent of four years of full-time employment within this role.</p>
				<p>I started as a Front-end developer for the University Relations department. It allowed me to familiarize myself with the technology stack used by the University and to learn Bootstrap and jQuery.</p>
				<p>After about a year and a half, I was able to move to a Back-end position, which was my goal in the first place. Then, I was able to further my understanding of the back-end technology we use: Ingeniux CMS, C#, and Razor.</p>
				<p>I also did an internship during which I learned more about Angular, Java (Spring framework), and Oracle databases.</p>
				<p>With that technological baggage in my hand, I am now ready to tackle the job market and am eager to learn new technologies and bring my skills and motivation to your projects.</p>
